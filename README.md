# Hi there 👋, I'm Abdallah Gabr

I'm a second-year Communications and Computer Engineering student at Benha University, passionate about transitioning from mobile development to network security and electronics. With proficiency in Java, Kotlin, and Dart, I’ve built user-friendly Android and cross-platform apps using MVVM architecture, Firebase, and RESTful APIs. Currently, I’m preparing for Cisco CCNA and Fortinet certifications to pursue a career in network security, alongside specialized training in CMOS analog IC design. I’m excited to contribute to innovative projects in cybersecurity and electronics.

## Currently Learning
- Cisco CCNA Routing and Switching
- Fortinet Cybersecurity Engineer Track
- CMOS Analog IC Design (prerequisite courses in progress):
  - PCB Design Essentials: A Practical Guide to Innovation
  - Mastering TCL Shell Scripting
  - CMOS Analog IC Design
  - Advanced CMOS Analog IC Design

## Skills
- **Programming Languages**:
  - Proficient: Java, Kotlin, Dart
  - Basic Familiarity: C, C++, Python
  - Working Knowledge: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL
- **Mobile Development**: Android SDK, Jetpack Compose, Flutter, Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Messaging), RESTful APIs, Retrofit, JSON
- **Networking**: Basic understanding of TCP/IP, routing, switching, VLANs (via Cisco Packet Tracer)
- **Tools**: Android Studio, Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub, Postman, Figma, Cisco Packet Tracer, LabVIEW, PCB Design Tools, MATLAB
- **Other**: Problem-solving, analytical thinking, teamwork, adaptability

## Projects
- **[RecipeApp](https://github.com/Abdallah1470/ITI_RecipeApp)**: An Android app for managing recipes with features like authentication, search, favorite meals, and in-app YouTube player. Built with Kotlin using MVVM, Retrofit for API integration, Room for local storage, and UI enhancements like Lottie animations, Glide, and dark mode. Enhanced my understanding of secure API integration and data management, relevant to network security.
- **[Service Link](https://github.com/Abdallah1470/service-link)**: A Flutter app connecting users with verified freelancers across various services. Features include multi-platform authentication (email, Google, Facebook), real-time data with Firebase, and a responsive UI with Riverpod state management. Gained experience in cloud-based authentication and real-time data handling, applicable to securing cloud environments.
- **Networking Simulation** (Academic Project): Configured a small network using Cisco Packet Tracer, implementing routing and VLANs to understand network fundamentals, foundational for network security.

## Certifications
- **Android Applications Development using Kotlin** - Information Technology Institute (Jul–Aug 2024)
- **Mobile App Developer Track** - Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI), Ministry of Communications and Information Technology of Egypt (Apr–Oct 2024)
